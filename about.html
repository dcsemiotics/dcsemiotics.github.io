            <h2>About DC Semiotics</h2>
            <p>Hello. I'm Will--also known as <a href="https://twitter.com/dcsemiotics">@dcsemiotics</a> on Twitter.</p>
            <p>And this is a website for my writing about kpop--especially Dreamcatcher--and kdramas that is too long for Twitter.</p>
            <p>For more about my approach to kpop and how I got into it, <a href="faq.html">see the FAQ</a></p>
            <p>I have an educational background in literary analysis, work in marketing, and have a life-long interest in where popular culture (including pop music) intersects with and draws upon other forms of culture--including pulp, literary, weird, and genre (science fiction, mystery, romance, horror).</p>
            <p>I live in the U.S. Midwest with my spouse, daughter, and cat.</p>
            <h3>What is semiotics?</h3>
            <p>Semiotics is the study of signs and symbols and their meanings. What that means is cultural and literary critics treat all sorts of things as texts that can be studies and take meaning from--from film and popular music to advertising (including branding) and comic books.</p>
            <p>Anyone who has grown up with the internet actually knows how to do semiotic analysis of culture. The ability to use and remix memes. Dropping takes on Twitter. Analyzing SNS posts by celebrities. Theorizing about kpops MVs. All of these actions are a form of semiotic analysis.</p>
