            <h2>KPOP FAQ</h2>

            <h3>How did you become a fan of Dreamcatcher?</h3>
            <p>My daughter started listening to kpop at the beginning of 2020. Later in the year, I heard about Blackpink somewhere (probably a podcast) and asked her about them. She gave me some recommendations of songs to listen to. I liked what I heard so she made me a YouTube playlist of other kpop songs. Dreamcatcher was on that list. I really like when pop is melded with other genres and grew up listening to alternative rock so, obviously, Dreamcatcher stood out to me.</p>
            <p>I kept exploring kpop, and especially Dreamcatcher, throughout Fall 2020. At first, it was just about their singles and music videos, but the more I became acquainted with their b-sides and the seven members, the more I was drawn in. So what started out as me trying to relate to my daughter has turned into a shared fandom, which culminated in our excitment over the Odd Eye comeback and then the Crossroads concert, which we watched live together and was an amazing experience.</p>
            <p>And, honestly, it's through dc that I've come to appreciate how kpop combines instrumental music, vocals, visual design, choreography as well as extra-concept material like variety, reality, and social media to create an experience for fans that is immersive, rewarding, interesting, and even at times emotionally and culturally meaningful.</p>
            <h3>Who is your DC bias?</h3>
            <p>My kpop fandom doesn't really operate in that way. Partly because I'm old. Partly because I'm male and heterosexual and don't think it's appropriate for me (but also am not interested in expressing my fandom in that way).</p>
            <p>So I'm very much OT7.</p>
            <p>If you interact with me on Twitter, I think it's apparent that I have a soft spot for Yooohyeon, Dami, and Handong, who I think are sometimes misunderstand, misrepresented, and/or ignored by certain segments of fandom (although that has begun to change, which is great to see).</p>
            <p>But I'm fine if you have a bias or bias line and wreckers, etc. (as long as you don't get weird and/or obsessive about it).</p>

            <h3>What are your thoughts on the DC name/logo?</h3>
            <p>I support a logo change as well as no other future comeback logos, packaging, imagery, costuming, etc. using dreamcatcher imagery.</p>
            <p>I'm also open to a name change, although I think that would be difficult for numerous reasons.</p>

            <h3>How do you feel about shipping?</h3>
          <p>I understand the appeal of shipping, particularly by LGBTQ fans who can find in it representation they too often don't receive from the larger culture. So I'm not going to judge you if you focus on a particular ship or ships (again: as long as you don't take things too far).</p>
          <p>But I don't ship any particular configuration of OT7. If you see me using a ship name, it's as a short hand for the relationship between the members and/or the personas of the members--not a hope or belief they are actually dating (or in any other sort of relationship other than friends and artistic collaborators)</p>
          <p>I don't read dc fanfic, but I have written it.</p>

            <h3>What other groups do you listen to?</h3>
            <p>Purple Kiss, Loona, and Rolling Quart are the other groups where I know all the members and follow them outside of music releases.</p>
            <p>I also regularly listen to Red Velvet, Mamamoo, (G)-Idle, Gfriend, f(x), fromis_9, and more.</p>
            <p>For solo artists: IU, Yezi, Kitti B, HA:TFELT, Mirani, and Savina & Drones.</p>

            <h3>Why do you hate boy groups?</h3>
            <p>I don't hate boy groups. But it's true that I listen to way more girl group kpop.</p>
            <p>I like Stray Kids. I'm intrigued by Day6. I'm a fan of Suga/August D's work and think the BTS song Inner Child is brilliant.</p>
            <p>But here's the thing: when it comes to male vocals, I prefer baritone or baritone-bass voices (think Matt Berenger from The National or Ian Curtis from Joy Division). There's also that I prefer rock, pop-rock, synthpop, disco, trap, EDM and the like when it comes to kpop and am less interested in hip-hop and R&B influences, which seem to be the focus of a lot of the most prominent boy groups (again: this is in relation to kpop--American music is a different matter).</p>

            <h3>What other music do you listen to?</h3>
            <p>Alternative music--especially post-punk, synthpop, new wave, and gothic--is the genre I listen to most. But I also like everything from metal (especially symphonic metal) and post-rock to grime and dream pop.</p>
            <p>My mainstays are Joy Division/New Order, The Cure, The National, Daughter, Stars, Chvrches, London Grammar, Taylor Swift, and Low.</p>
            <p>For grime, I mostly listen to Kano.</p>
            <p>Some lesser known musicians I recommend: Graveyard Club, Jenny Palacios, Gloria de Oliveira, Ghostly Kisses, Esben & The Witch, and tiny deaths.</p>
            <p>I haven't really dived into jpop or jrock, but I (predictably) listen to Maison Book Girl.</p>
